# Prediction-Diabetes-Disease-Using-Logistic-Regression
The project utilized a logistic regression model to predict future instances. The findings reveal that the model demonstrates commendable 
strengths in certain aspects but also exhibits limitations. The following summarizes the key points:

# Strengths:

This model is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into the impact of each feature on the predicted outcome.
The model exhibits computational efficiency, especially in the context of large datasets. Compared to more sophisticated models, the simpler 
model enables faster training and prediction timeframes.The model provides a probabilistic output, offering a measure of confidence or uncertainty 
in predictions. This is beneficial in scenarios where understanding the likelihood of an event is crucial.When we give more data as an input the 
model can accurately predict the output and increase the accuracy of the model.

# Weaknesses:

This model assumes a linear relationship between the features. In our dataset, we have 8 features and 1 categorical output. But our dataset 
length is 768. So, our accuracy shows 77-79%. The model may struggle with highly intricate relationships and interactions between variables. 
In cases where the underlying patterns are more, the model's simplicity might result in underfitting.

# Future Improvements or Extensions:

If the dataset exhibits class imbalance, employ techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using different class weights to address this issue. 
This can lead to improved performance, especially for minority classes. If the model gets more input data from the test data, then the model 
accuracy will be increased and can give more accurate data.Consider integrating logistic regression into ensemble methods, combining its 
strengths with other models such as Random Forest or Gradient Descent. Ensemble approaches can improve predictive performance by capturing diverse patterns.
